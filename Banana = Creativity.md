3.Multi-Image Blending & Remixing

Group Photo Generation:

The main test was to pick certain people from a group photo and merge them into a new group shot while keeping each person's features. Prompt: “Have the two kids in the front row take a photo together and swap in a clean, solid-color background.” You can really see how well it follows the instructions.<img width="1024" height="1024" alt="微信图片_2025-09-19_154645_056" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bbc10cef-7819-4912-b011-9daa053e8f47" /><img width="1024" height="1024" alt="微信图片_2025-09-19_154649_942" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0b6964fe-0007-44d3-81aa-a65e66bd66d1" />


pattern transfer

You can take a design and apply it onto an object in another image. For example, you could upload a pattern and a photo of a plain white T-shirt, and have the pattern printed right onto the T-shirt<img width="1080" height="1080" alt="微信图片_2025-09-19_154653_696" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4c6e08c1-ff8f-43f2-8507-f4f9c80696a3" /><img width="1080" height="1080" alt="微信图片_2025-09-19_154717_739" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fb166ec9-4ba4-48aa-a6a8-fad13abe6b4d" />

Merging people into the scene

We want to combine two different people into a single image, making sure the lighting matches and their poses look natural. We can upload two photos of different people and prompt them to take a selfie in a café.

Prompt idea: “Have the two people from Image 1 and Image 2 take a photo together in a café, with natural lighting and a matching environment.”<img width="512" height="512" alt="微信图片_2025-09-19_154736_237" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/05c59a0c-0e23-4dcd-a99f-ede9f5ee13e5" /><img width="864" height="864" alt="微信图片_2025-09-19_154745_706" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/249291b2-8f4d-44e9-bccf-3ea7db43c2a1" /><img width="992" height="992" alt="微信图片_2025-09-19_154819_799" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/025cd9e8-0880-4c9f-91a7-f0c459607c56" />




switch objects

Swap an object in an image with something else. For example, take a photo of a dog walking on the street and prompt it to replace the dog with a cat, keeping the same pose.![微信图片_2025-09-19_154829_078](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/312be578-90c7-4a23-819d-a6761b1e55a8)<img width="832" height="1109" alt="微信图片_2025-09-19_154832_969" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a876ea4e-d7e9-4b6d-987c-97365a65b4b0" />

6. Adding, Removing, and Editing Objects Locally
Removing Elements

Easily remove objects from your images without leaving any trace. For example, you could take a travel photo and prompt it to remove a passerby on the right side of the frame. Here, we’re showing some of the same sample images used in the previous article, now processed with Nano Banana.<img width="1080" height="1080" alt="微信图片_2025-09-19_155217_931" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5eca0e9e-b8f2-4904-8d44-8d8e8ffbedac" /><img width="1024" height="1024" alt="微信图片_2025-09-19_155228_088" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ce5f5d06-d3b4-4029-b992-ab717020cb5a" />
