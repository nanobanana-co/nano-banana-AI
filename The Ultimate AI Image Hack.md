Change to a white background

Change white background to a scene

This is a super common use case for main images and product pages, especially for small to mid-sized sellers on a tight budget who have to do the editing themselves.<img width="1132" height="519" alt="wechat_2025-09-02_150818_533" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7549b375-46a8-4b87-9a5e-c23ffcd82d9f" />

This one actually matches my expectations pretty well. My requests were for a simple background and a vanity table background.

For the last example, I wanted a model holding a fan with an indoor background.

Switch up the product color<img width="1135" height="520" alt="wechat_2025-09-02_150856_661" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/95ae9ab1-3f01-4e65-b098-f2a000dc2f62" />

Changing a product’s color is one of the classic e-commerce use cases. In the first example, the product stays perfectly intact—no distortion, no color changes.

In the second example, the logo on the clothes stays perfectly preserved, which is not easy at all.

The results are really impressive!

Swap the model/product

This one requires placing our product onto the model or having them hold it, so the standards are pretty high.<img width="1138" height="522" alt="wechat_2025-09-02_151008_806" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fb4747ac-9198-49fd-be4d-011cef0a63a4" />

OOTD

OOTD comes from the English phrase “outfit of the day”, meaning what you’re wearing today. On Xiaohongshu, a lot of fashion bloggers use it.

The common tag is #OOTD, and honestly, you could even say it counts as a productivity tool in a way.<img width="1137" height="516" alt="wechat_2025-09-02_151130_510" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ea1344c4-4f6b-4d12-8c2e-c09b8180d86c" />
