Change white background to a scene

This is a super common use case for main images and product pages, especially for small to mid-sized sellers on a tight budget who have to do the editing themselves.

This one actually matches my expectations pretty well. My requests were for a simple background and a vanity table background.

For the last example, I wanted a model holding a fan with an indoor background.

Switch up the product color

<img width="1080" height="661" alt="ÂæÆ‰ø°ÂõæÁâá_2025-09-19_145037_373" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4a3dc24f-5bc1-4675-b908-9d3273e79e17" />

Changing a product‚Äôs color is one of the classic e-commerce use cases. In the first example, the product stays perfectly intact‚Äîno distortion, no color changes.

In the second example, the logo on the clothes stays perfectly preserved, which is not easy at all.

The results are really impressive!

Swap the model/product

This one requires placing our product onto the model or having them hold it, so the standards are pretty high.
