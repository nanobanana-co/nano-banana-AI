# Create Your Own Black Goku with [Nano Banana](https://nanobanana.co/) – Free Guide!
Lately, all these “limited edition” figurines are blowing up on the platform—it’s super fun.  Turns out, they’re all made using the same AI model: Google’s Nano Banana.

I’ve been using this tool with some prompts to create a bunch of figurine models—just waiting to get them 3D printed

Today I’ll show you how to use the super-popular “Nano Banana” generation model for free, plus some fun and creative ways to play with it.

Model Overview

Google’s internal project Nano Banana (officially Gemini 2.5 Flash Image) is seriously impressive! Released on the 26th, it immediately grabbed attention and users are calling it “the highest-rated editing model in the world.”

What’s really amazing is its insane image consistency—it can keep a person’s features stable across different poses, lighting, and styles.

Because it blows other models out of the water when it comes to character consistency and lighting, the figures it generates look so real you’d swear they were actual photos of collectibles—no wonder everyone’s excited to create and share their own

There are quite a few ways to use “Nano Banana” for free now, but I’d definitely recommend Google AI Studio. Other methods sometimes give lower-quality images, and even Google’s own Gemini can throw errors occasionally.

The amazing thing about this model is how insanely accurate it is—the character details are spot-on, and even if part of the image is missing, it can fill in the gaps perfectly. Seriously, it’s next-level

For example, outfits! Some users even combined 13 images into a single one
