## 🛠 1. Clear Restoration Goal

- One user’s prompt was simply:  
  **`"Colorize this image"`**  
  This direct instruction works surprisingly well, clearly stating the user’s intent.  

- Another viral post used:  
  **`"Restore this picture"`**  
  This short form is often enough to trigger NanoBanana’s restoration pipeline.

## 📸 2. Style and Equipment Details

Adding technical context helps NanoBanana apply a more realistic rendering style. For example:

**Prompt:**  
`"Restore this vintage portrait in the style of a Nikon Z9 image, 35mm lens, ISO 200, cinematic focus."`

This adds professional photography cues and lighting expectations.

## 🎨 3. Enumerate Color, Lighting, and Detail

Users often break prompts into layered visual instructions:

**Example Prompt:**  
- Wide-angle camera framing  
- Softbox-style studio lighting  
- Shallow depth of field  
- Natural skin tones and ambient shadows

This structured approach tells NanoBanana exactly how to enhance color and composition.

## 🧍 4. Preserve Original Features

Restoration shouldn’t distort people’s faces or change the subject:

**Prompt Example:**  
`"Enhance image quality but preserve the person’s facial features, expression, and pose. Do not alter identity or background structure."`

This prevents hallucinated edits during restoration.

## 🧽 5. Specify Damage Repairs

Call out the exact flaws you want fixed:

**Prompt Example:**  
`"Fix scratches, remove fading and yellowing, and sharpen facial details without altering the original composition."`

Being specific about damage helps NanoBanana localize its changes.

## 🔁 6. Iterate and Refine

Most users recommend re-running or tweaking prompts:

> “NanoBanana rarely gets it perfect the first time. Generate 3–4 versions, then refine the best one.”  
> — Prompt engineer @refineai on Twitter

Small prompt edits or negative instructions (e.g. “avoid grain, no blue cast”) can greatly improve results.
